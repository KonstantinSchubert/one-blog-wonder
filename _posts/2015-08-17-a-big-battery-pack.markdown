It is hard to get excited about battery packs, because their sole reason of existence is the shortcoming of other products: Smartphones have advanced in many ways in the past decade, but their battery life hasn't followed suit.

On a long day in the city or out in the woods, making it with one charge until the evening can be a real challenge. A battery pack solves this issue. It should have USB connectors so you can charge with your normal charging wire and carry as much energy as possible.

The one we have is the [POWER BANK from EastAcc](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H9BEC8E/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00H9BEC8E&linkCode=as2&tag=thingswelik06-20&linkId=QKHO7ALGI34H46K3). It comes with a very high capacity (10000 mAh) and two USB sockets.
0n top of that, the price is really good. There is also an [updated version](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00XTXY0JW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00XTXY0JW&linkCode=as2&tag=thingswelik06-20&linkId=ND4JRAPAKJWCC6AZ) available.

Of course we don't carry it with us every day. But when we travel, hike, or just generally expect to have a long day, we pack it. It has become one of these items that we don't want to miss any more. Unless, of course, battery technology makes a jump forward. But I wouldn't wait for it.
