Here in Europe, the decision was made a few years ago to phase out the incandescent light bulb.
It was followed by a big public outcry; and while hoarding dozens of old-style light bulbs is maybe an overreaction,
it is hard to blame people for being afraid of the ugly, impractical and toxic energy-saving bulbs that were popular at the time.
Luckily, we donâ€™t have to put up with these any more. LED light bulbs are all the rage now, and while some of them come with their own set of issues,
the good ones are bright, robust and fully operating the second one turns the switch.

Here is one we really like: The Philips 9 Watt LED. [The version we have](http://www.amazon.de/gp/product/B008C0UQMC/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1638&creative=6742&creativeASIN=B008C0UQMC&linkCode=as2&tag=httpgeastword-21) fits only into european sockets, but if you're living in the US, [this here looks like the right model for you](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00TZ904Q2/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00TZ904Q2&linkCode=as2&tag=thingswelik06-20&linkId=G5ADKSJJRH3HVKBS). Or [buy in bulk](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00Y1YQVYK/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00Y1YQVYK&linkCode=as2&tag=thingswelik06-20&linkId=MHK3VSH6WY5X5MDL) to save even more.
We like the warm, bright shine and how it resembles the light bulbs we are used to. It just uses much less energy.
