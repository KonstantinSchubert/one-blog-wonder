Ear plugs are a necessity for the modern human. We are made with eyelids to shut the light from our eyes, and with a neck to look away. But for our ears, we need ear plugs. Don’t want to hear your neighbor moving and the noise from the street when you’re falling asleep? Don’t want to listen to other people’s conversations in the subway? It is either ear buds, or ear plugs.

We like these from oropax. They are soft, so we can wear them for hours. And they work well.
