If you have a computer, have some speakers and want to listen to music,
you need this amplifier. We bought it a year ago and we just love its sound quality
and how small, robust and simple it is. It has connectors for analog audio input and output for two speakers.

There is one button to turn it on, and one dial to adjust the loudness. That's it.
It doesn't get in the way. It is an amplifier. The exact model isn't available on
amazon any longer, but [here is a very similar one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CRLZGE/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B005CRLZGE&linkCode=as2&tag=thingswelik06-20&linkId=DUTPMSBZXWKPVKAL), with an additional headphone jack.
