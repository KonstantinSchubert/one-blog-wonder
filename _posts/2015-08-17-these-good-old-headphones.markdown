My father got me these awesome headphones ( Sennheiser ) when I was about 16 years old. I still have them and I
am convinced my father chose the best
combination of quality and price. They were 60 Euro back then, yet I am sure he wasn't saving on me. As a musician, he
had no qualms about dropping a small fortune on an instrument. It is just that 60 Euro can get you some very good headphones.

Of course you can spend more on a pair and there might be good reasons for some people to choose different ones.
But for us, and for you too maybe, these headphones are just the things we need. They are light, they are comfortable,
they can stand some beating. I have had them for close to 10 years now, and when the wire gave out once I just
soldered a new one back on.
