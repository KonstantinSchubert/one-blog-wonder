title:  "About Us"
---

We are a young couple living somewhere in Europe. Resources are valuable to us,
so we try to limit our possessions to the things we really like and need.
This blog is about good design in the broadest sense. It is about those items
that we value most. They can be especially useful, especially cheap or especially
beautiful. Ideally, they are all of this.
